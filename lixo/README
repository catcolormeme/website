What is the project about?

CATCOLOR is a token designed to reward loyal investors. Through the feature of USD reflections, you can passively earn while holding the token in your wallet. These reflections can be converted into other fiat currencies or reinvested to further increase your CATCOLOR balance.


What makes your project unique?

By acquiring and holding the CATCOLOR Token in your wallet, you become eligible to receive regular reflections in US dollars. These reflections are calculated based on your CATCOLOR token balance and the trading volume generated by the community. The more CATCOLOR you have and the more active the community is, the higher your daily reflections will be.
